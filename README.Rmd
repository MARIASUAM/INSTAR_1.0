Find model code as well as experiments codes under "scripts" folder. This folder also contains the extensions "rnd" and "time". In order to run INSTAR code, place the extensions together with the code (as they are now) or install them in your NetLogo folder.

Input files and parameter values are contained in "inputs" folder. Temperature maps can be accessed through the URL indicated below and should be unzipped and placed under "inputs/wimmed/" folder. 

Code optimization has been performed and "optimization" folder contains pre- and post-execution times per function.
